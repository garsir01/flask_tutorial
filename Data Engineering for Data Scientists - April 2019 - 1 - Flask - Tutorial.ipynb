    "> 3. When you're ready, start a new Bash console from the Consoles page.\n",
    "> 4. The free PythonAnywhere account only allows access to external sites (e.g. GitHub) over HTTPS (not SSH), so your will need to provide your GitHub username/password instead of creating an SSH keypair. If your repo is public, this step isn't needed as you won't need to authenticate for read access. Otherwise, you may wish to enable git credential caching with a 24hr timeour: **`git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=86400'`**\n",
    "> 5. If you have 2FA enabled on your GitHub account, you will need to generate a [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) to use instead of your password.\n",
    "> 6. Clone your repo using HTTPS: **`git clone https://github.com/<GITHUB_USERNAME>/flask-tutorial.git flask_tutorial`**\n",
    "> 7. **`cd flask_tutorial/`**\n",
    "> 8. Create a virtualenv: **`mkvirtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.7 flask_tutorial`**\n",
    "> 9. Install the requirements specified in your repo: **`pip install -r requirements.txt`**\n",
    "> 10. Create a PythonAnywhere Web App:\n",
    ">   - Open a new tab to the PythonAnywhere Dashboard and navigate to the Web tab.\n",
    ">   - Click \"Add a new web app\" (_this will create your app at `<USERNAME>.eu.pythonanywhere.com`_)\n",
    ">   - Select \"Flask\" then \"Python 3.7\"\n",
    ">   - Change the Path to `/home/<USERNAME>/flask_tutorial/flask_app.py`\n",
    "> 11. On the following page, under \"Virtualenv\", enter `flask_tutorial`, reload your app and check it out by visiting http://USERNAME.eu.pythonanywhere.com/.\n",
